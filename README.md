This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error related to optional properties. The `printName` function accepts an object with a required `name` property and an optional `age` property.  When calling `printName` with an empty object, TypeScript throws an error because the required `name` property is missing. The solution shows how to handle this using optional chaining or type guards.
